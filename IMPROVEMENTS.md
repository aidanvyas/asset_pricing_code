# Suggested Improvements for `replicate_fama_french.py`

## 1. Code Duplication
There is a noticeable amount of code duplication in the functions `compute_rm()`, `compute_hml()`, `compute_rmw()`, `compute_cma()`, and `compute_umd()`. Refactoring common operations into reusable functions or a class could reduce duplication and make the code more maintainable.

## 2. Error Handling
The code includes basic error handling for division by zero in the `wavg()` function. However, it might be beneficial to add more comprehensive error handling throughout the script, especially where data is being read from files or external sources.

## 3. Performance
The script uses `pd.merge()` and `groupby().apply()` operations, which can be performance-intensive, especially with large datasets. It might be worth exploring the use of `dask.dataframe` or other parallel processing libraries to improve performance.

## 4. Hardcoded File Paths
The file paths are hardcoded, which could make the code less flexible if the directory structure changes. It might be better to use a configuration file or environment variables to manage file paths.

## 5. Data Validation
Before processing the data, it would be prudent to add checks to ensure the data is in the expected format and contains the necessary columns. This can prevent unexpected errors during processing.

## 6. Testing
There are no tests included in the script. Implementing unit tests for the functions would help ensure that changes do not break existing functionality.

## 7. Documentation
While the comments are helpful, adding a more detailed docstring at the beginning of each function explaining the inputs, outputs, and the function's purpose would be beneficial.

## 8. Version Control of Data Files
The script writes to CSV files and then deletes them. It might be useful to have a version control system for the data files to track changes over time.

## 9. Comparative Analysis
The `compare_with_fama_french()` function performs a comparison with the original Fama-French factors but does not indicate how the results of this comparison are used. It would be helpful to document the expected outcome of this comparison and how discrepancies should be handled.

## 10. Code Comments
Some comments indicate future work (e.g., "In the future, I will take a closer look on which stocks are allowed in the breakpoints and portfolios."). It would be useful to track these as issues or to-dos in the repository.
