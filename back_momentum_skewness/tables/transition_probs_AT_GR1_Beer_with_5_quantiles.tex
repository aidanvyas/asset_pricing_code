Transition probabilities for AT_GR1 with 5 quantiles in the Beer industry. \\
\hspace*{1em}This sample starts in July 1963, ends in December 2022, and includes all NYSE, AMEX, and NASDAQ common stocks for which we have market equity data for December of year t-1 and June of year t, and book equity data for t-1. The portfolios are constructed on book equity to market equity at the end of each June using quintile breakpoints.  The book equity used in June of year t is the book equity for the last fiscal year end in t-1.  Market equity is calculated at the end of December of year t-1.  More specific definitions can be found in the Appendix.  The data is measured monthly, with all statistics annualized.  1\%, 5\%, and 10\% statistical significance are indicated with ***, **, and *, respectively. \\
